## MGMA VLCA

### Voluntary Labour Compliance Assessment (VLCA)

Voluntary Labour Compliance Assessment (VLCA) is a labor standards assessment tool made by collaboration between Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association (MGMA) and {{< ext-link "https://www.ilo.org/actemp/about-us/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=ACT%2FEMP%20seeks%20to%20foster,democracy%20and%20socio%2Deconomic%20development." "The Bureau for Employers' Activities (ACT/EMP)" >}} of {{< ext-link "https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm" "International Labor Organization (ILO)" >}}. The tool can provide an in-depth look at the company's performance against national labor laws and international labor standards for the employers especially in manufacturing industry in order that they can do self-assessment on their own compliance of national labor law using this tool.

Voluntary Labor Compliance Assessment program was officially launched on 17th Feb 2020 by MGMA to all its member factories and it has been a valuable service of the association since then.

After COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020-21, MGMA kicked off conducting VLCA on-site starting from Dec 2021 and official launched {{< ext-link "https://www.myanmargarments.org/official-launch-to-online-system-of-voluntary-labour-compliance-assessment/" "VLCA Online System" >}} on 10th Nov 2022 to speed up the assessment and the association also launched MGMA Grievance Mechanism along with. Presentation slides about VLCA Online System and Grievance Mechanism.
